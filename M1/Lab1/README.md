#  Module 1 Lab 1 instructions - Co-creating an MVP Plan with GenAI

In this lab, you'll practice using Generative AI as a co-creator to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) plan. You'll start with a basic prompt and improve it using structured principles, then work with an AI agent to scope and refine your app idea.

## Step 1: Define Your Prompt
Use this template to help frame your request to the AI agent of your choice:

```
You are a [relevant role/expert].
I need help with [specific task/problem].
My situation is [relevant context/background].
Please [specific request] in [desired format].
```
