#  M1 Lab 1 - Interact with the Streamlit Demo

In this first lab, you'll interact with the final demo app that you'll build out in this course, which is a dashboard app for the customer reviews subset of the Avalanche data set.

The next video will walk you through how to run Module 1 Lab 1. You can follow along in the lab by downloading the relevant files from the GitHub repo:

- The Avalanche Dataset: https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/rapid-prototyping-with-streamlit/tree/master/Avalanche

- Jupyter notebook: https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/rapid-prototyping-with-streamlit/blob/master/M1/Lab1/RAP_M1_Lab1.ipynb

You can see the end product of what that youâ€™re building in this lab at the following URL:
