#  Module 1 Lab 1 instructions - Co-creating an MVP Plan with GenAI

In this lab, you'll practice using Generative AI as a co-creator to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) plan. You'll start with a basic prompt and improve it using structured principles, then work with an AI agent to scope and refine your app idea.

## Step 1: Define Your Prompt
Use this template to help frame your request to the AI agent of your choice:
```
You are a [relevant role/expert].
I need help with [specific task/problem].
My situation is [relevant context/background].
Please [specific request] in [desired format].
```

Example:
```
You are a high school math teacher that wants to integrate technology into your classroom.
I need help coming up with an app that will help students learn linear algebra.
My students struggle with math anxiety and need visual and hands-on tools.
Please help me brainstorm a prototype in bullet point format.
```
## Step 2: Provide MVP Guidelines
Share these principles to help the AI guide you more effectively:

- Define your end goal
- Determine your target audience
- Identify metrics for success
- Prioritize must-have features for the MVP
