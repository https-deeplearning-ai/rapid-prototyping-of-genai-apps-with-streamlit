# M1 Lab 2 Instructions - Build a simple Streamlit app

In this second lab, you'll take your first step towards building a Streamlit app for your capstone project which is building a dashboard app for the Avalanche data set.

Briefly, you'll take the pre-processed version of the Avalanche data and read it into the app. In later labs you'll actually build this very data set from scratch.


## Install prerequisite libraries
To follow along, make sure that you have all the prerequisite libraries installed. For your convenience, a list is provided in the requirements.txt file in the GitHub [repo](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/rapid-prototyping-of-genai-apps-with-streamlit/tree/master/M1/Lab2).

It is recommended that you work locally on your computer. Once there, using the command line, install the packages via pip as follows:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run apps

To run the Streamlit app for [Module 1 Lab 2](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/rapid-prototyping-of-genai-apps-with-streamlit/tree/master/M1/Lab2), follow these steps:
- Download the course repo as a .ZIP file from [here](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/rapid-prototyping-of-genai-apps-with-streamlit/tree/master).
- Unzip the downloaded repo.
- Place the unzipped folders on the working folder you choose in your computer.
- Go to M1/Lab2 in your working folder.
- From within this folder, run the following from your command line:
```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
The lab video will walk you through how to update the code and more functionality.
