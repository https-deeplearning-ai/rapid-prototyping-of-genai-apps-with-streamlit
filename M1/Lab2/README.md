# M1 Lab 2 - Build a simple Streamlit app

In this second lab, you'll take our first step towards building a Streamlit app for our capstone project which is building a dashboard app for the Avalanche data set.

Briefly, you'll take the pre-processed version of the Avalanche data and read it into the app. In later labs you'll actually build this very data set from scratch, which we'll cover later.


## Install prerequisite libraries
To follow along, make sure that you have all the prerequisite libraries installed. For your convenience, a list is provided in the requirements.txt file in the GitHub repo.

You can install the packages via pip as follows:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run apps

To run the Streamlit app for Module 1 Lab 2, navigate to:
- Folder M1/Lab 2
- From within this directory, run the following from your command line:
```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
The lab video will walk you through how to update the code and more functionality.
