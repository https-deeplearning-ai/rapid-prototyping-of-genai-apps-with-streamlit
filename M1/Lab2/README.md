# M1 Lab 2 Instructions - Build a simple Streamlit app

In this second lab, you'll take your first step towards building a Streamlit app for your capstone project which is building a dashboard app for the Avalanche data set.

Briefly, you'll take the pre-processed version of the Avalanche data and read it into the app. In later labs you'll actually build this very data set from scratch.


## Install prerequisite libraries
To follow along, make sure that you have all the prerequisite libraries installed. For your convenience, a list is provided in the requirements.txt file in the GitHub repo.

It is recommended that you create your own environment in your computer. Once you have it, install the packages via pip as follows:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run apps

To run the Streamlit app for [Module 1 Lab 2](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/rapid-prototyping-of-genai-apps-with-streamlit/tree/master/M1/Lab2), navigate to:
- Folder M1/Lab 2
- From within this directory, run the following from your command line:
```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
The lab video will walk you through how to update the code and more functionality.
