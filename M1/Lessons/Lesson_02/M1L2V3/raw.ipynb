    "\n",
    "## Lab Overview\n",
    "Welcome to the Avalanche Shipping Analytics Lab! In this hands-on exercise, you'll apply the concepts from Module 2 to analyze real shipping data from Avalanche's logistics operations. Instead of customer reviews, you'll be working with shipping logs that contain critical information about order fulfillment, carrier performance, and delivery tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Scenario\n",
    "Avalanche's operations team has been collecting shipping data across multiple carriers and regions. They need insights into:\n",
    "- Carrier performance and delivery success rates\n",
    "- Geographic distribution of shipments\n",
    "- Shipping status trends over time\n",
    "- Potential bottlenecks in their logistics network\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to load this shipping data into Snowflake and prepare it for analysis using the same techniques you learned in the lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Navigate Snowsight to create databases, schemas, and stages\n",
    "2. Upload and verify data files in Snowflake\n",
    "3. Load data using both Pandas and Snowflake DataFrames\n",
    "4. Create and populate Snowflake tables from raw data\n",
    "5. Perform basic data exploration and validation"

    "- **Shipping Date**: When the order was shipped\n",
    "- **Carrier**: Logistics company handling the delivery\n",
    "- **Tracking Number**: Unique tracking identifier\n",
    "- **Latitude/Longitude**: Geographic coordinates\n",

    "2. **Create Schema**\n",
    "   - Click into your new database\n",
    "   - Go to the \"Schemas\" tab\n",
    "   - Click \"+\" to add a new schema\n",
    "   - Name it `SHIPPING_ANALYTICS`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create Stage**\n",
    "   - In your database, go to the \"Stages\" tab\n",
    "   - Click \"+\" to create a new stage\n",
    "   - Choose \"Internal Named\" and name it `SHIPPING_STAGE`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Upload Data File**\n",
    "   - Save the shipping-logs.md file to your local machine\n",
    "   - In Snowsight, navigate to your stage\n",
    "   - Upload the shipping-logs.md file\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Data Quality**: What data quality issues did you notice in the shipping logs? How would you address them in a production environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scalability**: How would this process change if you had 1,000 shipping log files instead of one? What would you do differently?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Business Value**: What insights from this shipping data could help Avalanche improve their logistics operations?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Next Steps**: What additional data would you want to combine with this shipping data to create a more comprehensive logistics dashboard?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "If you finish early, try these additional challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Visualization**: Create a simple visualization showing carrier performance using matplotlib or seaborn\n",
    "2. **Automated Pipeline**: Write code that could automatically process new shipping log files as they arrive\n",
    "3. **Data Validation**: Create checks to ensure data quality before loading into Snowflake\n",
    "4. **Performance Optimization**: Research Snowflake best practices for table design and query performance\n",
